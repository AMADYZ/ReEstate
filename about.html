                SteelWave and its predecessor companies, 
                Legacy Partners Commercial and Lincoln Property West,
                 have been active in commercial real estate for over 50 years.
                  We are a vertically integrated real estate company, 
                  believing that an “all-hands-on deck” team approach to managing real 
                  estate assets is superior to an allocator’s model of outsourcing to third-party 
                  service providers.

                It’s the rare combination of these elements that defines SteelWave and the partnerships
