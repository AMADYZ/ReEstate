                          To that end, we’ve spent years building out our internal and external

                    Alpha design is a term we use to describe our
                     internal design process.
                     We start by defining the
                      problem then we create a purposeful,
                      strategic design narrative that captures
                       the story and essence of each project.
                       This clear direction helps us design with
                        depth, resonance,
                        and consistency across all facets of the projects

                 and memorable sense of place. Without tenants, a space is... just a space.
                  We attract a rich blend of companies and cultures by not only delivering
                   world class architecture—but also by curating exceptional amenities
                    such as restaurants, baristas, and other vendors. That human element brings
                     life to each project, amplifying and enriching each SteelWave experience.

                    Today’s creative office tenant wants more than just office space.
                    They want a home to attract and develop the best talent.
                    They want a place that raises their profile with customers and investors.
                    Most of all they want a space that reflects and enhances the brand
                    they’ve worked so hard to create. 
                    SteelWave spent years developing a design team made up of
                    artists, architects, graphic designers, curators, landscape architects, metal, and glass
                    fabricators—dedicated to making each space unforgettable. 
                    Guided by the principles of our deep design program, our creative office portfolio offers
                    user experiences closer to what you might find at a boutique
                    hotel or high-end custom home than that of an office building.

                     Biotechnology is the fastest growing vertical within
                     health care today, making up 18% of the GDP. In 2020,
                     venture capital investment in this sector increased
                     by 56% year over year for a record $29.9B.  
                     SteelWave is a pioneer in this sphere; we developed
                     our first lab space in the 80s and have capitalized
                     on $1.5B in life sciences activities in the last twelve
                     months alone. We understand the next generation of biotech
                     clients desire many of the same amenities as our creative
                     office clientele.  
                     Our key regions are among the most sought out life science
                     markets in the nation.The next project to be delivered,
                     theLAB Berkeley due fall 2021, combines our strength
                     in design and placemaking with our experience developing
                     leading edge lab space to create the next generation of life

                    Creative industrial is an exciting new avenue that offers
                    solutions to tenants that, until now, were forced into product
                    types that were not aligned with their needs. These tenants
                    may require a small portion of their footage to interact with
                    the public— or cater to clients that expect a more elevated
                    space than traditional industrial spaces would otherwise offer.
                    Some of these companies may have a small, but important,
                    retail component. There is also the potential to create
                    maker villages by attracting multiple tenants with complementary
                    uses. Because of our extensive knowledge and experience
                    attracting exciting retailers as well as our experience in 
                    delivering millions of square feet of Industrial buildings, 
                    SteelWave is poised to be a market leader in this new product 
                    type.
